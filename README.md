# Vigenere Cipher Script

### Description:

This Python script implements the Vigenère cipher, a method for encrypting and decrypting text using a keyword.

### Installation:

Just download and execute the python file in the terminal.

Usage:

* Open a terminal in the repository directory.

* Run the script with the following command:

        python3 Vigenere.py [-d] [message] [key]

* [-d] (optional): Use this flag to activate decryption mode.
* [message]: The text to encrypt or decrypt.
* [key]: The keyword to use for encryption or decryption.

### Additional Notes:

* The Vigenère cipher is susceptible to frequency analysis, especially with short or weak keys. Use stronger ciphers for sensitive information. Consider implementing unit tests to ensure the script's functionality and catch potential errors.
